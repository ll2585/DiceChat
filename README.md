DiceChat
========

This is my attempt to make a version of a game playable over the internet/with a computer.

Right now it only works locally but I hope to eventually test it on a remote server.

The game implementation is actually not important, my attempt was to see if I could figure out how to deal with the networking and asynchrony, as well as work with some JQuery.

It uses the Tornado framework.

The game is pretty simple, each player gets to roll two dice, and the player can choose to reroll either of the dice once. First to 100 wins.

Later on I might implement more (real) games, once I get the server stuff working.
